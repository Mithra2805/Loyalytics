Loyalytics – Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning 📊🔮
Loyalytics is a machine learning model built to predict customer churn in subscription-based businesses. By identifying customers at risk of leaving, businesses can take proactive measures to enhance retention, reduce churn, and optimize customer experience.

🔍 Project Overview
In this project, we use machine learning algorithms to predict which customers are likely to churn based on various factors such as demographics, transaction history, and engagement metrics. The goal is to help businesses improve customer retention strategies and reduce the financial impact of churn.

Key Features:
Dataset: Real-world customer data with demographic details, subscription information, and transaction history.
Algorithms Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
Achieved Results:
Precision: 87%
Recall: 83%
Accuracy: 85%
🛠️ Technologies & Tools
Python: Primary programming language.
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Data Preprocessing: Feature Engineering, Handling Missing Data, SMOTE for Imbalanced Datasets.
Modeling: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
Model Evaluation: Cross-validation, Hyperparameter Tuning, ROC-AUC.
📦 Installation
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Loyalytics.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Loyalytics
Install the required dependencies:

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
📊 How to Use
Load the dataset by running load_data.py to import and preprocess the customer data.
Train the model by running train_model.py, which will apply multiple machine learning algorithms and tune hyperparameters.
Evaluate the model using the performance metrics in evaluate_model.py.
Make Predictions on new data using the trained model (see predict.py for an example).
🔧 Example Usage
Run the following code to predict churn for a new customer:

python
Copy code
from model import churn_predictor

# New customer data
customer_data = [/* customer features here */]

# Predict churn probability
churn_prob = churn_predictor.predict(customer_data)
print(f"Churn Probability: {churn_prob}")
📈 Results & Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations that help to better understand the model’s performance and the data insights. These are available in visualizations/.
